Absolutely — here’s a **detailed explanation of Notion** and how real tech teams use it to build software products like Forgea. I’ll also explain **PRDs**, **architecture diagrams**, **linked docs**, and **sprint planning + retrospectives**, exactly as real product managers, founders, and engineers use them.

# 🧠 What is Notion?

**Notion** is an all-in-one workspace used for:

* Writing documents (like Google Docs)
* Organizing wikis and pages (like Confluence)
* Managing tasks (like Trello)
* Planning roadmaps and sprints (like Jira Lite)
* Collaborating across teams (like Slack + docs together)

> In startups and big companies, Notion is used by **PMs, designers, engineers, marketers, and founders** to stay aligned on product-building.

## 📘 What is a PRD (Product Requirement Document)?

A **PRD** defines *what* a feature should do, *why* it matters, and *how* it should behave. It’s like a blueprint given to engineers and designers.

### ✅ A real PRD includes:

| Section                  | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**                | Feature name (e.g., “AI Task Generator”)                                   |
| **Goal**                 | Why are we building this?                                                  |
| **Problem**              | What user or business problem does this solve?                             |
| **Feature Scope**        | What exactly will be built — UI, API, logic                                |
| **User Stories**         | From the user’s point of view (e.g., “As a dev, I want to pick a task...”) |
| **Acceptance Criteria**  | What must be true for the feature to be “done”                             |
| **Risks & Edge Cases**   | What could go wrong                                                        |
| **Timeline**             | When this feature will ship and who’s working on it                        |
| **Links to Jira/GitHub** | Tasks, issues, or code branches related to it                              |

✅ You write this in **Notion** as a page. Then you link it to Jira tickets, GitHub issues, and design files.

## 🏗️ What is an Architecture Diagram?

A **system/architecture diagram** shows the **technical structure** of your platform: how your backend, frontend, database, and external services connect.

### Real engineers use it to:

* Understand how data flows
* Visualize which service talks to which (e.g., frontend → Supabase → OpenAI)
* Plan scaling and performance

### In Notion:

You embed or attach your diagrams:

* Use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) for hand-drawn-style diagrams
* Or use tools like Lucidchart, Whimsical, or Figma diagrams
* Paste images or embed them inside a page like `System Design → Architecture Overview`

## 🔗 What are Linked Docs in Notion?

**Linked Docs** are Notion pages that are **interconnected** using:

* **@Mention** of other pages
* **Relation columns** in databases (e.g., relate PRD to Sprint 1)
* **Linked Databases**: you can show tasks from Jira/Notion task board inside the PRD

### Examples:

| Link From                  | Link To                          | Why |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --- |
| PRD → Sprint Page          | To track progress                |     |
| Sprint → Tasks             | So team sees what’s in sprint    |     |
| Task → GitHub PR           | Track which code implements what |     |
| PRD → Design Page          | To show UI mockups               |     |
| Project Page → Contributor | Show who worked on what          |     |

✅ This lets everyone stay in sync — “1 source of truth”.

---

## 🗓️ What is Sprint Planning?

**Sprint Planning** is a weekly (or biweekly) planning ritual in agile companies where:

* The team picks a few **tasks (tickets)** to complete this week
* Each task is connected to a bigger **Epic or Feature**
* Engineers commit to deadlines and priorities

### Sprint Page in Notion includes:

* Sprint Title + Dates (e.g., Sprint 1: July 6–12)
* Goals of the sprint
* List of tasks with assignees
* Velocity tracking (optional)

✅ You use this page to run meetings, assign work, and track “in progress” status.

---

## 🔁 What are Retrospectives?

After each sprint, real teams run a **Retrospective** — to reflect and improve.

### Format:

| Section                 | What to write                                       |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ What went well?       | Finished waitlist system, deployed landing page     |
| ❌ What didn’t go well?  | GitHub auth integration took longer than expected   |
| 💡 What can we improve? | Start backend stubs earlier, do daily standups      |
| 🎯 Action Items         | Aru to split backend into smaller tasks next sprint |

✅ In Notion, this is a single page under `Sprint Planning → Retrospectives`
