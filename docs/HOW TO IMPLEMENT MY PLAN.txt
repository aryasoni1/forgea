✅ How to collaborate across frontend, backend, and QA

✅ How to deploy features with confidence

✅ How to take feedback and fix bugs fast


Excellent — if you're building a platform to **simulate real-world experience**, you must **understand how real engineers actually work in startups, MAANG, and SaaS companies**.

Let’s walk through a **realistic example of how engineers work on a Web POS project**, across different types of companies — **step-by-step**:

---

## 🎯 Sample Project: WebPOS System (Point-of-Sale)

> Imagine the company is building a **POS system** for small retail stores — with features like inventory, cart, billing, receipts, login, analytics, etc.

---

## 💡 PART 1: HOW REAL ENGINEERS WORK (ROLE + FLOW)

We’ll break it down by company type and map what an engineer actually does on this project.

---

### 🚀 A. Startups (0–50 people)

| Characteristic                 | Behavior                        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| ✅ Everyone wears multiple hats | Fullstack, DevOps, design, etc. |
| ⏱️ Fast iteration cycles       | Weekly or bi-weekly sprints     |
| 📞 Close to users              | Feedback is immediate           |
| ⚠️ No fixed process            | Some chaos, lots of freedom     |

---

### 🧑 Example: **You’re the Fullstack Engineer at a startup**

#### 🔧 Day-to-Day Tasks:

| Task                                               | Tool/Tech Used                      |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Discuss POS features with founder                  | Notion, Slack, or a quick Zoom call |
| Break features into tasks                          | GitHub Project board / Jira         |

✅ **You ship features independently, own a part of the product, and wear many hats.**

---

### 🧠 What You Simulate in Your Platform for Startup Experience:

* Project Board → GitHub Kanban (Backlog → In Progress → PR → Done)
* Tasks → “Add Product UI”, “Create Orders API”, etc.
* PR Reviews → Teammates leave comments, suggest changes
* Feedback Rounds → Another user/tester adds bugs or requests
* Weekly Demo Day → Users present features on Zoom/recorded Loom

Would you like me to help **create simulation templates** for:

1. GitHub issues (with sample tasks & subtasks)?
2. Project board layout for WebPOS?
3. PR templates and review rules?
4. Task checklists with “real-world” expectations?

Just say: **“Create a full simulation setup for WebPOS”** — and I’ll generate it for your platform.
